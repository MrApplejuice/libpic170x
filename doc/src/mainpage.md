libpic170x
==========

The libpic170x modular toolbox library that is intended to make regular tasks less painful to implement by either giving a basis to work off, or a toolbox to take components from to help to get done what one needs to get done.

The library was developed for the [PIC16(L)F1705](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F1705) and [PIC16(L)F1709](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC16F1709) microcontrollers. It is likely that the library will not work with other microcontrollers.
