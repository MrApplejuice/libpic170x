/**
 * \file freq.h
 * \brief Global timing definitions used for timing critical library components.
 * 
 * 
 * This file defines important timing preprocessor variables that are used 
 * throughout all library components. All libraries are based on the 
 * assumption that the processor clock frequency the PIC microcontroller 
 * operates on does not change over time. It should be set once at the start
 * of the program never be touched again.
 * 
 * The frequencies are set via the OSCCON bits of the PIC microcontroller.
 * freq.h derivs the correct OSCCON-bits from the defined _XTAL_FREQ. _XTAL_FREQ
 * must therefore as a compiler definition from the outside. By default, it is
 * set to 8000000 in `Makefile` but any of the following _XTAL_FREQ frequencies 
 * are supported by libpic170x:
 * 
 * \code{.unparsed}
 *   32000000
 *   16000000
 *   8000000
 *   4000000
 *   2000000
 *   1000000
 *   500000
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Lower frequencies are not supported because the core library timer0 would 
 * become unusable due to huge counter steps.
 * 
 * OSCCAL_BITS
 * 
 * One of the core-featues of `freq.h` is that is exposes the OSCCON bits that 
 * the  main application should set through the preprocessor definition 
 * `OSCCON_BITS`. Before using any other library functions this OSCCON bits 
 * should be set by the application using libpic170x.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * \code{.c}
 *   #include <freq.h>
 *   #include <xc.h>
 * 
 *   int main() {
 *     OSCCON = OSCCON_BITS;
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * \endcode

 * this should not be required, but it can be handy for sanity checks. It is
 * advisable to include a call to this function at the start of any program and
 * exit to a safe fail-state when the function returns false since the behavior
 * of libpic170x is undefined if the build arguments do not match between
 * a libpic170x static library and main application.

 *     Returns true in case the build arguments are matching. If the function
 *     returns false, exit to a safe fail-state.
